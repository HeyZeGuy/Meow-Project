# Ledge Grab / Wall Climb 

I think of this like how cats react when they fall off of something. They panically kick downwards and grab the ledge.
Maybe we could use this as either a ledge-grab or a wall-climb mechanic.


## Movement (Ledge Grab)

Like in the in many platformers, when the player gets near a ledge he grabs it.
Should he be able to jump from the grabbing state? puzzles around that?
It's really important to get the panic animation right.


## Movement (Wall Climb)

When the player touches a wall he can perform a small wall climb.
I'ts not a crazy wall grab like Celeste, more of a Yoshi float - but on walls.
If this is added then we need to make sure rooms can't be cheesed.
