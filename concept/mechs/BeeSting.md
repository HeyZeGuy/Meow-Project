# Bee Sting

After being stung by a bee, the player bounced back and then turned into a "ballon" cat.
Abilities:
- Float.
- Be bounced on.
- Tail can be used as a swing?

The entire ability is timed (how much breath the cat has).

## Movement

The player moves super slow and movement shortens the ability timeout.
The player can cough to get a movement boost while consuming a lot of breath.

After let's say 5 coughs the player is transformed back (blinking indication).
